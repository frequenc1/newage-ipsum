newage-ipsum
===============

A new aged ipsum generator inspired/ported to php by Seb Pearce https://github.com/sebpearce/bullshit.
It was just to good to not use with tests!

###Usage

```php
$generator = new \NewAgeIpsum\Generator();
$generator->generateSentence();
```

###Faker
You can also use it with the fantastic Faker library! (It's actually what its designed for)

https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker

```php
$faker = Faker\Factory::create();
$faker->addProvider(new NewAgeProvider($faker));
```
This will replace the default Faker\Provider\Lorem methods with newage versions

```
word                    // 'dreamscape'
words($nb = 3)          // array('develop', 'healing', 'harmonizing')
sentence()  // 'You will soon be guided by a power deep within yourself â€” a power that is technological, unlimited.'
sentences($nb = 3)      // array('We are in the midst of a internal condensing of fulfillment that will open up the infinite itself.', 'As you self-actualize, you will enter into infinite joy that transcends understanding.')
